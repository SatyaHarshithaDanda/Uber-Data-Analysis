# 🚖 Uber Data Analysis

This project analyzes Uber ride data to explore user behavior, demand patterns, and operational efficiency. Using Python and powerful data visualization tools, the project helps identify trends that can aid in better decision-making for ride-sharing platforms and city planners.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze trip data to understand peak hours, ride distribution, and trip frequency.
- Identify temporal and spatial patterns in Uber rides.
- Visualize ride demand to suggest improvements in service and resource allocation.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset typically includes:
- `Date/Time`: Timestamp of the ride
- `Lat`, `Lon`: Geographic coordinates
- `Base`: Base code affiliated with the ride
- Other optional features (day, hour, weekday, etc.) extracted through feature engineering

## 📊 Key Analyses

- Hourly, daily, and monthly ride patterns
- Most active bases and pickup locations
- Heatmaps for geographical ride distribution
- Temporal trends based on weekdays/weekends
- Seasonal and time-based surge pattern identification

## 📌 Insights

- Peak ride hours are concentrated around morning (7–9 AM) and evening (4–6 PM) rush hours.
- Fridays and weekends show the highest ride volumes.
- Certain bases consistently show higher demand.
- Seasonal demand trends vary, indicating potential for dynamic pricing strategies.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series decomposition and analysis
- Geographic data visualization
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
